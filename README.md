# HAND RECOGNITION USING COMPUTER VISION

This project focuses on developing a system capable of recognizing and interpreting hand gestures using computer vision techniques for 
hands-free control that enhances human-computer interaction for various applications.

Using libraries like OpenCV and MediaPipe in Python, the system captures hand movements through a webcam, recognizes specific gestures, 
and maps them to commands, such as adjusting volume or brightness.

It uses machine learning algorithms like CNNs and SVMs for accurate gesture classification and applies optimization techniques for real-time 
responsiveness.
